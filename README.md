INX Future Inc, is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider and have provided us with data of their employees. The main task of this project is to find out what are most import factors contributing to employee’s performance and build a machine learning model that will help predict employee’s performance rating. This machine learning model will be used to hire new employees.
Since the purpose of this data analysis is to be able to predict the performance rating of the employees, we first had to do the exploratory data analysis to find meaningful insights of the data.
